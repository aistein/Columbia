Delivery Notes:
--------------
(Question 1: Pair Swap) ->
    Directory: pair_swap
    Files:
    - pair_swap.ml
        + contains my solution in OCaml
    - pair_swap_demo.log
        + a recording of an OCaml shell session with my results

(Question 2: Word Frequency Counter) ->
    Directory: word_frequency_counter
    Files:
    - wfc_setup.ml
        + contains all the functions used manipulate "wordlist"
    - word_frequency_counter.mll
        + contains given code with modifications,
          opens the (necessarily pre-compiled) module "Wfc_setup"
    - word_frequency_counter_demo.log
        + demonstrates generation of *.ml files, compilation, and execution with
          results from the Linux command-line
    - wfc_compile_run (executable)
        + bash script for joint compile & run of this program

(Question 3: Add Variables & Sequences to Calculator )
    Directory: calculator
    Files:
    - ast.mli
        + defines types and expressions
    - parser.mly
        + defines context-free grammar for calculator
    - scanner.mll
        + maps acceptable input characters to internal representation used by
          the interpreter
    - calc.ml
        + defines machine actions for each operation listed in the parser,
          and retrieves standard input
    - calculator_demo.log
        + demonstrates test cases and outputs for the calculator program from
          the Linux command-line
    - calc_compile_run (executable)
        + bash script for joint compile & run of this program (it will wait
          for you to enter acceptable standard input)
